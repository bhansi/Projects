            Past
        </h2>

		<p>
			I was born in Toronto; my birthday is 4/20/98. My family immigrated from Punjab, India.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I grew up in an apartment building in the Jane and Finch area; it wasn't much but it was home.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Present

        <p>
            Fast forward many years, my family resides in the suburbs of Brampton.
        </p> 

        <p>
            I now live 4 hours away in Windsor, where I am pursuing a higher education.
