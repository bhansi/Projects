First, a signal handler is installed to handle SIGINT and SIGSTP is ignored.

Then the user is given 10 seconds where if they press ctrl-c, a message is
    shown and if they press ctrl-z, it is ignored.

Then the donothing program is executed using execlp.

It can then be observed that the previously ignored signal, SIGSTP,
    continues to be ignored (the user presses ctrl-z but nothing happens)

It can also be observed that the default signal hangler is restored for
    the SIGINT signal and it is now affects the program (terminating it
    when the user presses ctrl-c)
